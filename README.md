# 🐍 Python Practice & Mini‑Assignments

This repository contains small Python scripts, exercises, and practice problems I’ve worked through while sharpening my programming fundamentals. Each file focuses on a specific concept — from loops and conditionals to functions, data structures, and basic algorithms.

The goal of this repo is to document my ongoing growth as a Python developer and provide a space to experiment with ideas, test logic, and build fluency through repetition.

## 📘 What You’ll Find Here

- Short, self‑contained Python scripts  
- Practice problems and coding drills  
- Explorations of core programming concepts  
- Simple algorithmic exercises  
- Clean, readable code with comments where helpful  

These files are intentionally lightweight — they’re meant to show the building blocks behind larger projects.
